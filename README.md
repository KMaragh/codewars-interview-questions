# CodeWars Challenges
A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Currently doing and pushing at least one solution every day.

**Link to Profile:** https://www.codewars.com/users/KMar

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Kotlin & Java

Everyday, at some point during the day, I solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

A few of the solutions currently may not be optimized, but after every 100 kata's I will check out what I have already completed.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I have learned while tackling an endless supply of questions is the pattern that arises for each type of question. After going through so many questions, it becomes easier to notice which data structures make my life easier while solving the kata's.
