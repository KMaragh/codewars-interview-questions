Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]




solution:

fun greet(name: String): String {
  //your code here
    return ""
}



Test:


import kotlin.test.assertEquals
import org.junit.Test

class SampleTests {
  @Test
  fun `Basic tests`() {
    assertEquals(greet("Ryan"), "Hello, Ryan how are you doing today?")
    assertEquals(greet("Shingles"), "Hello, Shingles how are you doing today?")
  }
}
