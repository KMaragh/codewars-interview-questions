Problems:


Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input: output)

makeComplement("ATTGC") // return "TAACG"

makeComplement("GTAT") // return "CATA"


Solution:

package dna

fun makeComplement(dna : String) : String {

}

Test:

package dna

import kotlin.test.assertEquals
import org.junit.Test

class TestExample {
  @Test
    fun test01() {
       assertEquals("TTTT", makeComplement("AAAA"));
    }
    @Test
    fun test02() {
       assertEquals("TAACG", makeComplement("ATTGC"));
    }
     
}
