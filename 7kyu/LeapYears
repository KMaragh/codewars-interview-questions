Problem:
In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
Examples can be found in the test fixture.

Solution:

fun isLeapYear(year: Int) : Boolean {
  // code here
}

Test:
import kotlin.test.assertEquals
import org.junit.Test

class TestExample {
  @Test
  fun `Basic Tests`() {
    assertEquals(false, isLeapYear(1234))
    assertEquals(true, isLeapYear(1984))
    assertEquals(true, isLeapYear(2000))
    assertEquals(false, isLeapYear(2010))
    assertEquals(false, isLeapYear(2013))
  }
}
